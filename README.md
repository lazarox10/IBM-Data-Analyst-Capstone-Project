# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

Welcome to my **IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project**, the final step in completing the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. In this project, I take on the role of a newly hired **Data Analyst** for a global IT and business consulting firm known for its expertise in IT solutions.

My objective is to apply the data analysis skills I’ve learned throughout the course to solve a real-world business challenge. As a data analyst, I will gather, analyze, and report insights about **emerging skill requirements** in the IT industry, helping the company stay competitive in this rapidly changing landscape.

## Project Overview:
I will follow a structured data analysis workflow, just like in a real-world data analyst role. Here’s an overview of the key stages of my project:

### Module 1: Data Collection
My first task is to gather a list of in-demand programming and technical skills. I’ll collect data from various sources, such as:
- Job postings
- Training platforms
- Surveys

To collect this data in formats like CSV, Excel, and SQL, I’ll use tools like web scraping, APIs, and databases.

### Module 2: Data Wrangling
Once I’ve collected the data, I’ll clean and prepare it using **data wrangling techniques**. This involves handling missing data, normalizing values, and ensuring the data is well-structured for analysis.

### Module 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
After preparing the data, I’ll perform **exploratory data analysis** (EDA) using statistical methods to uncover trends and patterns. I’ll look for correlations, distributions, and outliers, and gain insights into the data using **Pandas**, **Numpy**, **Scipy**, and **Matplotlib**.

### Module 4: Data Visualization
Next, I’ll create visualizations to make the data more digestible and actionable. Using tools like **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **IBM Cognos Analytics**, I’ll build graphs and charts to highlight trends such as:
- The most in-demand programming languages
- Popular databases
- The most commonly used development environments (IDEs)

### Module 5: Dashboard Development
I will then build a **dashboard** using **IBM Cognos Analytics**. This dashboard will compile all the key insights, allowing stakeholders to interact with the data and explore emerging trends visually. It will support the company in making strategic decisions about skill development and training investments.

### Module 6: Final Presentation
The project concludes with a **presentation of my findings**. I’ll use storytelling techniques to present the key insights, trends, and recommendations to stakeholders. My presentation will include:
- An executive summary
- Key findings from the data analysis
- Visualized trends and conclusions based on the data

My ability to communicate data effectively will be evaluated as part of my final deliverable.

## Tools and Technologies I’m Using:
- **Python**: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **SQL**: For relational database analysis
- **IBM Cognos Analytics**: To build dashboards and create visual reports
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For coding, analysis, and documentation

## Conclusion:
By completing this capstone project, I’ll demonstrate my proficiency in **data analysis**, from **data collection and preparation** to **visualization and presentation**. This project simulates the tasks I’ll perform as a professional Data Analyst, ensuring I’m well-equipped to handle real-world challenges in the industry.
